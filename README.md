# FT-Welcome-Dev (Level 1) ðŸ˜„
This is a basic welcome challenge for Fruitask Developer. The challenge is piece of cake.. no sweat!
Just to understand the Fruitask environment and used programming language, we need to test your superstars skills.

## Step 1
Create a successful AJAX method, using JQUERY. On the PHP push your personal details in an array stored in accounts.json file.
```
"data": [
        {
            "Name": "Fruitask",
            "Email": "ftwelcomedev@gmail.com",
            "Short Bio": "I love chicken BBQ"
        }
 ]
 ```


## Step 2
Once you're done, you need to call your data only from the accounts.json using PHP and print in an index.html file and make a basic profile card UI
using Tailwind CSS.

## Step 3
Next, upload your completed challenge in Github and prepare your repository URL. Make sure it is PUBLIC for a moment.

## Step 4
Make a CURL or HTTP request using Fruitask API using CREATE method. Learn <a href="https://fruitask.com/developer/">here</a>.
Use this test API ``2fe0e2cf6e158467dffac00e9c7d2704``, and BASE_ID ``R3lwYk1NV0JsaTNaa2J4dy9aaG9CWGNJeFRNR1lZWjkyMS9lMkxSRUt1Y3ZjT2RLT2hYMnpaVlZic2R2TUZKVjlOYlFESkdHRWJvPQ`` using ``&method=create:row`` and ``data`` for the values.
You need to pass this value
``` 
{
            "Email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
            "URL": "YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL"
           
 }
```

That's it! Told yah.. No sweat! Fruitask is pure environment without any used framework like Lavarel or JS Libraries,well there's one JQUERY, but most of the backend is all PHP using AJAX gijutsu and Tailwind for CSS. We want to step up Fruitask with you. So we will see your work soon!
